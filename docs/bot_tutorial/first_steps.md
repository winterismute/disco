# Bot Tutorial

Disco provides a built-in set of tools for building and running Discord bots which can be used to quickly and easily create integrations. Within this tutorial you'll be shown how to install Disco, write plugins, and run bots. This tutorial assumes you've already followed the [Installation Steps](../installation.md).

## Creating a Bot

The first step to creating bots is to actually register them on Discord itself. To do this, you'll need to be logged into your Discord account on the browser and then navigate to [My Apps](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). Here you'll have the option to create a new application, and once created you can add a bot user (by clicking "Create a Bot User") to your application. Finally, you'll want to keep track of the bot user token which can be shown by clicking the "click to reveal" link next to the token field.

Once you have a Discord bot account, you can then setup your workspace. For now we'll just need a folder (perhaps called `disco-tutorial`) with a few files in it:

```
disco-tutorial/
  config.yaml
  plugins/
    __init__.py
    tutorial.py
```

{% hint style='tip' %}
The \_\_init\_\_.py file is required for Python to find your plugin, but it can remain empty.
{% endhint %}


Within the config file, paste the following template configuration and modify the token key to contain the token you obtained above:

```yaml
token: 'MY_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'

bot:
  plugins:
		- plugins.tutorialplugin
```

Now, within the python file (`tutorial.py`), lets write some code:


```python
from disco.bot import Plugin


class TutorialPlugin(Plugin):
    @Plugin.command('ping')
    def command_ping(self, event):
        event.msg.reply('Pong!')
```

And finally, we're ready to start and test the bot. We can do this by executing the following command from within our project directory:


```sh
python -m disco.cli --config config.yaml
```

If all is successful, you can then test your bot by mentioning it with the command, like so:

```
@tutorial#1234 ping
```

At this point, you've achieved the creation and setup of a very simple bot. Now lets work on understanding and working with more Disco features.
